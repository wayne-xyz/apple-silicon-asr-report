The former have had their first employment in this worldwide war of the nations.

The Goose with the Golden Eggs A certain man had the good fortune to possess a goose that laid him a golden egg every day, but dissatisfied with so slow an income and thinking to seize the whole treasure at once, he killed the Goose and cutting her open, found her just what any other Goose would be. Much once more and loses all. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse A country mouse invited a town mouse and intimate friend to pay him a visit and partake of his country fair.

Not since gunpowder was first employed in warfare has so revolutionary a contribution to the science of slaughtering men been made as by the perfection of aircraft and submarines. The former have had their first employment in this worldwide war of the nations. The latter, though in the experimental stage, as far back as the American Revolution, have in this bitter contest, then for the first time brought to so practical a stage of development, as to exert a really appreciable influence on the outcome of the...\n"
